    <p>This was a tough decision - I was interested in all of the mentoring group topics, but narrowed it down to JavaScript and Ruby.  I feel slightly more comfortable with my JavaScript skills at this point, so I've decided to continue learning JavaScript on my own and join the Ruby group if possible - I believe I'll get the most opportunities for learning this way.</p>

    <p>I've been very drawn to Ruby every since beginning to experiment with programming last year. It's a language that is very beginner friendly, but more than that I noticed that the people who are often drawn to Ruby tend to be really fun :)  I've enjoyed building some apps using Ruby on Rails, and am eager to increase my skills and meet others to collaborate with using this awesome programming language!</p>
